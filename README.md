# Estimating Phillips Curve and NAIRU

The Phillips Curve is a mathematical relationship that shows an inverse realationahip between unemployment and inflation. The NAIRU is that level of unemployment below which inflation is expected to rise. During the recovery after the Great Recession unemployment levels in the U.S. experienced a steady deacrease. Inflation on the other hand held steady and we did not notice any rise in inflation. This called to question the standard Phillips Curve relationship and many economists today argue that it is not a good benchmark to use for monetary policy. In this project I estimate the Phillips Curve relationship in the U.S. economy and test its significance.

In the first step I estimate the aggregate Phillips Curve for the U.S. economy using three different measures of inflation. The first is a standard inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The second is Greenbook forecasts for inflation prepared by the staff at the Federal Reserve and released to FOMC members before their meetings. The third is inflation forecasts created by the FOMC members, including presidents of the 12 regional banks and the governors. 

The above exercise shows insignificance of the Phillips Curve relationship over the period 1992-2007. I further investigate whether the Phillips Curve relationship might hold for some sections of the economy while being insignificant for the others. To do this I consider various demographic groups and disaggregate the unemployment rate by these groups. The different subgroups that I consider include 

* education: high-skill vs low-skill
* gender: male vs female
* race: white vs black
